<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>
<p>Hi , I’m Karn Navneet, a 19-year-old B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I’m currently in my 2nd year and living in a PG accommodation, balancing my academic grind with a disciplined fitness routine and a passion for creating impactful content.<br />
</p>
<p><h3>🎯 What Drives Me</h3>
I believe in consistency over motivation — whether it's writing clean code, staying fit, or pushing a new idea live. I’ve always been someone who values structure, self-discipline, and continuous improvement. My days usually begin with morning runs and bodyweight exercises and end with focused gym sessions — a balance that keeps both my mind and body sharp.<br />

<p><h3>💻 Tech Side of Me</h3>
🔧 Languages: C (core), Python, and currently exploring full-stack web development<br />

📚 Course Focus: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Engineering Principles<br />

👨‍🔬 Academic Project Work: Developing structured C programs for lab practicals (e.g., BES07010 - Data Structures Lab)<br />

💡 Coding Style: Clean, documented, and optimized for understanding<br />

🧠 Goal: Build scalable systems and gain hands-on software development experience<br />
</p>
<p><h3>🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Discipline</h3>
⏰ Morning Routine: Running & bodyweight workouts (6 AM–7 AM)<br />

🏋️‍♂️ Evening Gym: Strength & conditioning training (7 PM–8 PM)<br />

🚶‍♂️ Weekly Active Days: Extra cardio (walking/running) on Sundays & Wednesdays<br />

🥗 Diet Style: Simple, macro-aware meals suited for a PG lifestyle<br />

💪 Current Focus: 15-day home workout challenge (started July 2, 2025)<br />

Fitness is more than a habit—it's my daily reset button. I often share motivational reels and content to inspire others on their own journey too.<br />
